# Cat vs Dog Image Classification using SVM

## Project Overview
This project uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify images into two categories: cats and dogs. It aims to explore the application of different SVM kernels in image classification tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: cv2, numpy, skimage, sklearn, pandas

### Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the project folder.
2. Ensure Python is installed on your system.

## Usage
Run the ProjectFile.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment. The notebook is set up to use the dataset provided in the existing folder structure without modification. Simply follow the code and execute the cells to train and evaluate SVM models for cat vs. dog image classification.

## Note: The project assumes the following folder structure for data:

(Project Folder)
-test
    -cat
        (cat images)
    -dog
        (dog images)
-train
    -cat
        (cat images)
    -dog
        (dog images)
-ProjectFile.ipynb
